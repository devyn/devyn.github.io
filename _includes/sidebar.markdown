I'm a computer science and linguistics enthusiast. You can find me on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/devyn/).

I'm part of the [ΩF:∅ Working Group](http://wg.oftn.org/), and have contributed
to Core Estimator, oftn-bot, and TPFS.

I'm currently working at [ZE PowerGroup, Inc.](http://ze.com/) in Richmond, BC
at which I am a student intern handling the software development needs of the
marketing department.
